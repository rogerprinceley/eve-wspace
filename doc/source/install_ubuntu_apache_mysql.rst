Install: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with MySQL and Apache
==============================================

This guide will walk you through installing Eve W-Space on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 
using a local MySQL server and serving requests with Apache and gunicorn through
mod_proxy. It assumes a clean install and root shell access.

Note: Ubuntu 13.10 untilizes Apache 2.4, it is recommended that you use Nginx instead.

Requirements
------------
* 764MB RAM with 1GB preferred for high-traffic instances. This may be 
  flexible depending on your specific load.
* The following packages in addition to the normal core install:
  
    * git-core 
    * build-essential
    * python-dev
    * python-pip
    * apache2
    * libapache2-mod-wsgi 
    * bzip2
    * memcached
    * libmysqlclient-dev
    * mysql-server
    * libxml2-dev
    * libxslt-dev
    * rabbitmq-server
    * supervisor

You can install all required packages with the following. You will be 
prompted for a mysql root password. You may leave this blank if you wish, 
but it is recommended that you set a secure password and remember it for later.::

    $ sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential python-dev python-pip \
    apache2 bzip2 memcached libmysqlclient-dev mysql-server libxml2-dev libxslt-dev \
    rabbitmq-server supervisor libapache2-mod-wsgi 

Note: if you want to use PostgreSQL, replace libmysqlclient-dev and mysql-server with libpq-dev and postgresql.

You will also be needing to edit text, so make sure to install your favorite text 
editor if *nano* or *vi* (not *vim*) aren't your cup of tea:

Next, you will need to upgrade *distribute* and install *virtualenv*:::

    $ sudo easy_install -U distribute
    $ sudo pip install virtualenv

Finally, you must create the MySQL database for Eve-Wspace to use:::

    $ mysql -u root -p

Enter the root password you set when installing MySQL before:::

    Password:

Then, create the database and grant access to it to a new mysql user called 
*maptool* with a password you should remember for later. If you want to simply 
use the root MySQL user, simply ignore the *GRANT PRIVILEGES* command.::

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE evewspace CHARACTER SET utf8;
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON evewspace.* TO 'maptool'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<insert a password>';
    mysql> quit

Create a User
-------------

You should not run Eve W-Space as root for security. We will create a dedicated account 
called *maptool* with a home directory of */home/maptool*. You can name this user 
whatever you want, just replace all instances of */home/maptool* with your user's 
home directory.::

    $ sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash maptool
    $ sudo passwd maptool

Set Up the Home Directory
-------------------------

Let's become our user for this part to ensure permissions are proper and switch to the 
install location:::

    $ sudo su maptool
    $ cd /home/maptool

Now, let's create a directory to be used for serving static files later:::

    $ mkdir /home/maptool/static

Next, you need to get the Eve W-Space files. We can either clone the latest revision from 
*git* or you can download a packaged release and unpack it.

To clone from Github:::

    $ git clone https://github.com/marbindrakon/eve-wspace.git

To use a packaged release:

You need to download eve-wspace from http://marbindrakon.github.com/eve-wspace/ 
to get latest zip or tarball package (0.1.1 at time of writing):::
	
    $ wget https://github.com/marbindrakon/eve-wspace/archive/v0.1.1.tar.gz

Then you can unpack the file and rename the directory to *eve-wspace* to 
match the clone method:::

    $ tar xvzf v0.1.1.tar.gz && mv eve-wspace-0.1.1 eve-wspace

Install Eve-Wspace Environment
------------------------------

Next, you should create and activate a virtual Python environment for Eve 
W-Space so that it cannot conflict with any system Python packages::: 

    $ virtualenv --no-site-packages /home/maptool/eve-wspace
    $ source /home/maptool/eve-wspace/bin/activate

You will notice that your shell changes to include *(eve-wspace)* when the 
virtual environment is active.

Now you can install the required Python packages:::

    (eve-wspace)$ pip install -r /home/maptool/eve-wspace/requirements-mysql.txt

Use requirements-postgresql.txt if you are using PostgreSQL.

Configuring local_settings.py
-----------------------------

Now for the fun part, copy the local_settings.py.example file to 
local_settings.py in the same directory, open it up, and edit it to suit 
your enviornment:::

    (eve-wspace)$ cd /home/maptool/eve-wspace/evewspace/evewspace
    (eve-wspace)$ cp local_settings.py.example local_settings.py
    (eve-wspace)$ nano local_settings.py

While editing, you should pay particular attention to the top part of the file, 
ensuring that the database statement matches the database, user, and password 
you created in MySQL earlier and that you add a SECRET_KEY and set the STATIC_ROOT value:::

    #Example:

    # Set this to False for production or you'll leak memory
    DEBUG = False
    #DEBUG = True

    # Set this to a secret value, google "django secret key" will give you
    # plenty of generators to choose from

    SECRET_KEY = 'sadf98709283j7r098j09a8fd7sdfj89j7f9a8sdf09a8fd'

    # Set this to the directory you are service static files out of so that
    # manage.py collectstatic can put them in the right place

    STATIC_ROOT = "/home/maptool/static/"

    DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql', # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
                    'NAME': 'evewspace',                      # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
                    'USER': 'maptool',                      # Not used with sqlite3.
                    'PASSWORD': 'really_secure_password',                  # Not used with sqlite3.
                    'HOST': '',                      # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.
                    'PORT': '',                      # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.
            }
    }

Look at the rest of the *local_settings.py* file and see if there is anything 
you want to change. The default values for memcached and amqp work for the 
Ubuntu memcached and rabbitmq defaults.

Initializing the Database
-------------------------

Initializing the database falls into two parts: Loading the Eve static 
data and initializing the Eve W-Space instance.

Static Data
^^^^^^^^^^^

CCP releases a Static Data Export for each major patch in MS SQL format. 
Steve Ronuken makes MySQL conversions available shortly thereafter. These 
conversions can be downloaded from http://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/ if you are 
going to be installing multiple instances, you should download the dump once 
and re-use it if at all possible.::

    (eve-wspace)$ cd /home/maptool
    (eve-wspace)$ curl -O https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/mysql55-odyssey-1.0.12-89967.tgz
    (eve-wspace)$ gunzip mysql55-odyssey-1.0.12-89967.tgz
    (eve-wspace)$ tar xvf mysql55-odyssey-1.0.12-89967.tgz
    (eve-wspace)$ mysql -u maptool -p evewspace < odyssey-1.0.12-89967/mysql55-odyssey-1.0.12-89967.sql

The sql import will take a few minutes to run. When it completes, your MySQL 
database will have all of the Static Data Export tables available.

Initializing Eve W-Space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next you will need to run several commands to set up the Eve W-Space tables 
and preload them with data. If you encounter errors here, they are most likely
caused by bad settings in *local_settings.py*, not having the virtual 
environment activated, or permissions.::

    (eve-wspace)$ cd /home/maptool/eve-wspace/evewspace
    (eve-wspace)$ ./manage.py migrate
    (eve-wspace)$ ./manage.py buildsystemdata
    Note:This will take a while (~5-10min)
    (eve-wspace)$ ./manage.py loaddata */fixtures/*.json
    (eve-wspace)$ ./manage.py defaultsettings
    (eve-wspace)$ ./manage.py resetadmin
    (eve-wspace)$ ./manage.py syncrss
    (eve-wspace)$ ./manage.py collectstatic --noinput

Using the Development Server
----------------------------

If you've made it this far, congratulations! Eve W-Space is set up. 
From here, you can run the console development server directly or continue 
with setting up the rest of a production environment.

To start the development server:::

    (eve-wspace)$ cd /home/maptool/eve-wspace/evewspace
    (eve-wspace$ ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Now you can navigate to your server on port 8000 and see your instance. 
However, you need to have celery running as well for many tasks to work 
properly. In another shell:::

    (eve-wspace)$ cd /home/maptool/eve-wspace/evewspace
    (eve-wspace)$ ./manage.py celery worker -B --loglevel=info

When both are running at the same time, you should be able to use all functions. 
If you want things to run a bit more permanently, continue reading.

Setting Up a Production Stack
-----------------------------

To serve Eve W-Space in production, you should use a dedicated http daemon to 
serve static files and either serve the Eve W-Space application itself either 
through the http daemon itself (as with Apache's mod_wsgi setup) or through a 
seperate tool which the http daemon will proxy requests to. This guide follows 
the Apache route.

Installing Gunicorn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This guide uses Gunicorn, a lightweight wsgi server written in Python to serve the Django app itself.

To install:::

 $ (eve-wspace)$ pip install gunicorn

Configuring Supervisor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unless you want to run celery and gunicorn through the console in 
*screen* or *tmux*, you will want to daemonize them in some way. 
This guide uses supervisor, but there are many other options available.

At this point, you can log out of the maptool user and go back to our normal 
account:::

    (eve-wspace)$ deactivate
    $ exit

You need to tell supervisor about the tools you want it to run, to do that, 
you need to create a config file in */etc/supervisor/conf.d* for gunicorn and 
celeryd:::

    $ sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/celeryd.conf

    [program:celeryd]
    command=python manage.py celery worker -B --loglevel=info
    directory=/home/maptool/eve-wspace/evewspace
    environment=PATH="/home/maptool/eve-wspace/bin"
    user=maptool
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    redirect_stderr=True

    $ sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/gunicorn.conf

    [program:gunicorn]
    command=/home/maptool/eve-wspace/bin/gunicorn_django --workers=4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 settings.py
    directory=/home/maptool/eve-wspace/evewspace/evewspace
    environment=PATH="/home/maptool/eve-wspace/bin"
    user=maptool
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    redirect_stderr=True

To finish it off, you need to stop and then start supervisor to reload the 
config and start the services:::

    $ sudo service supervisor stop
    $ sudo service supervisor start

And confirm that celeryd started successfully:::

    $ sudo supervisorctl status

    celeryd                          RUNNING    pid 4335, uptime 33 days, 19:16:02
    gunicorn                         RUNNING    pid 4330, uptime 33 days, 19:16:00

If either are not in the RUNNING state, either examine the log files in */var/log/supervisor/celeryd-stdout-xxxxxxxxxx.log* and */var/log/supervisor/gunicorn-stdout-xxxxxxxx.log* or try running them interactively as discussed previously.

Configuring Apache (mod_proxy)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: Apache 2.4 removes underscores in headers and is not compatible with IGB functions

Before configuring the Apache VirtualHost, ensure that mod_proxy is enabled:::

    $ sudo a2enmod proxy
    $ sudo a2enmod proxy_http

To make Apache serve Eve W-Space on a subdomain (e.g. *http://map.foo.bar*), 
you can set up a VirtualHost by placing the following text (adapted for
your environment) in */etc/apache2/sites-available/evewspace*:::
    <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerName map.foo.bar
            DocumentRoot /home/maptool/static
            ProxyPass /static !
            ProxyPassReverse /static !
            Alias /static /home/maptool/static
            <Directory /home/maptool/static>
                    Order allow,deny
                    Allow from all
            </Directory>
            ProxyPass / http://localhost:8000/
            ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8000/
    </VirtualHost>

Activate the new VirtualHost by:::

    $ sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/evewspace /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/evewspace
    $ sudo service apache2 restart

Congratulations! Your Eve W-Space instance should now be available at whatever 
your ip or host name was from the Apache config. Please see the 
:doc:`getting_started` page for your next steps. Keep in mind that your instance 
will have a default administrator registration code until you change it, 
so do that ASAP.
